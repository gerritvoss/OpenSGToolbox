/*! \class OSG::ComponentDecorator
    \brief An element of a graphical user interface.

    A Component represents a single element of a user interface. In other
    frameworks they may be called widgets or controls. All concrete GUI elements
    inherit from Component, like OSG::Button, OSG::Label, OSG::TextField,
    OSG::InternalWindow, etc.

    \par Component states:
    Components have states for Enabled, Focused,
    MouseOver, and Visible.  If a Component has Enabled == false, it doesn't receive
    or produce any events. If a Component has Visible == false, it is not drawn. 

    \par Event response:
    Components can respond to Mouse, Key, and Focus events.

    \par Event production: Components produce Mouse, Key, Focus, Component, and
    ToolTip events if enabled.

    \par Drawing: Component handles setting up the clipping of a component, and
    the drawing of the Border, Background, and Foreground.  The Border,
    Background, and Foreground used when drawing a Component depends on it's
    state, and can also be overridden by inheriting classes. There are separate
    Border, Background, and Foregrounds for Disabled, Focused, Rollover, and No stat
    states.

    \par Layout: The position and size of a Component is controlled by the
    OSG::ComponentContainer that contains it. For simple OSG::ComponentContainer
    like OSG::Panel, the OSG::Layout attached to the container is used to control
    the position and size of components.  For more complex containers like
    OSG::SplitPanel, the position and size are controlled by the specific
    behavior of the container.
    \warning User code should never set the position or size of a Component
    directly, this is controlled by the OSG::ComponentContainer of the Component.

    \par Focus: Zero, or one Component can have focus in a OSG::InternalWindow.
    Component has methods for taking, removing, or moving the focus.

    \par ToolTips: A component can have a ToolTip that will appear after a
    configurable amount of time passes with the mouse over the Component.

    \par PopupMenus: A OSG::PopupMenu can be attached to a Component that will
    be activated with a right-click mouse interaction.

    \par Scrolling: Components can be contained in a OSG::Viewport or a
    OSG::ScrollPanel for viewing large Components.

    \par Inheriting: Concrete GUI elements that inherit from Component must
    implement drawInternal().

    "\n"
    "\\par Event response:\n"

    "\\par Drawing: Component handles setting up the clipping of a component, and\n"
    "the drawing of the Border, Background, and Foreground.  The Border,\n"
